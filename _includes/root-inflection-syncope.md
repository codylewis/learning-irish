### Root Inflection: Syncope

> The term Syncopation in Irish grammar refers to a phenomenon where the vowels in the final syllable of a multi-syllable root-word are removed before adding a suffix. These vowels would have gone unpronounced in the newly-formed word created by the addition of the suffix, and thus are unnecessary. In the verb examples shown [below], Eitil is shortened to "eitl" by syncopation before adding the various verb endings. Freagair is shortened to "freagr" in the same way. A small group of second conjugation verbs resist syncopation and make up a small category of exceptions to the rule of syncope: aithris, foghlaim, fulaing, freastail, taistil, tarraing, tuirling.[^root-inflection-syncope]

Outside of what is mentioned in the quote above, the conjugation follows the same structure as outlined in the [previous section](#second-conjugation) for the second conjugation.
