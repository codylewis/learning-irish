[^d]: The affirmative of ol *(drink)* and other verbs starting with a vowel have a **d'** before the verb in the past tense, <u>D’</u>ól sé é *(He drank it)*, while the negative, Níor ól sé é *(He didn’t drink it)*, drops the d'
[^1]: Imperfect/conditional already include lenition in the root verb
[^unlenite]: The conjugations in the imperfect / conditional tense will lenite the initial consonant if lenitable, so when the question / negative question needs to eclipsis the verb, the lenition of the root verb must been removed. Bris (break), imperfect tense: <u>bh</u>risinn *(I would break)*. Imperfect tense in the form of question: An <u>mb</u>risfinn? *(Would I break?)*. Notice the removed lenition after the initial **h**.
